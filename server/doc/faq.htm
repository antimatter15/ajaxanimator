Ajax Animator 0.2 Beta RC 1 FAQ By RandomProductions.
<br><b>GENERAL QUESTIONS</b>
<br><br><b>Q: I don't understand some of the weird things in the FAQ!</b><br>
Here is a break-down of conventions I use in this FAQ:
To refer to an item in a menu, such as the about option of the help menu, I write Help | About. For something like the foo theme option under themes under the view menu, I use View | Themes | foo.
<br><br><b>Q: This FAQ seems a bit... silly. Why is that?</b><br>
Because the "man" forced it to be that way.
<br><br><b>Q: No, seriously. Why is the FAQ silly?</b><br>
Because I felt like it.
<br><br><b>Q: What is Ajax Animator?</b><br>
Press Help | About for more information in an about box than should be legal. But seriously, Ajax Animator is a standards-compliant, cross-platform, web-based animator supporting a variety of different formats.
<br><br><b>Q: I hate ads! How do I make them stop!?</b><br>
You can't. But look on the bright side: If you didn't see those ads, the developer wouldn't get any money, and would have to do one of two things: either remove Ajax Animator from the web completely, or make you pay to use it.
<br><br><b>Q: How can I make the animator crash?</b><br>
Why would you want to do such a thing? I'm not telling you.
<br><br><b>Q: What is a grue?</b><br>
Ask ZORK*

USING THE INTERFACE
<br><br><b>Q: There are too many themes to choose from! Please help.</b><br>
There are two things you can do: either pick one randomly, or complain to the developer to cut down on the number of themes (I don't recommend option #2). If you want my pick, go with the Warp Zone theme.
<br><br><b>Q: I can't find the Warp Zone theme! Where is it?</b><br>
What Warp Zone theme?
<br><br><b>Q: How do I draw stuff?</b><br>
With the tools to the left of the animator.
<br><br><b>Q: I can't get out of this stupid FAQ!</b><br>
I'm not helping you. You said this FAQ was stupid. :*(
<br><br><b>Q: Fine. I can't get out of this FAQ! Help.</b><br>
You see the tab near the bottom of the screen, with the blue book on it saying FAQ? Either click on the [x] in the tab (this will get rid of the FAQ from your available tabs), or click on one of the tabs beside it.
<br><br><b>Q: I can't use my interface! The menus are unreadable.</b><br>
The problem is with your theme. Try to find the View|Theme, and select another theme. Quite a few themes have this problem, it may take a little before you find a good theme.
